# Junior Front End Developer List of Challenges

## Advice

Before you start doing all the challenges, I recommend you start with the basics. As a Front End Developer I have set up builds using Grunt, Gulp, Broccoli, Webpack, RequireJS. All those build systems are great but some can be challenging to set up, that is why I’m recommending [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html).

It’s easy to set up, self explanatory and I believe it is a good start for Junior developers to understand why we need a build system for each of our projects.

## Development

- Use vanilla Javascript, I repeat use vanilla Javascript.
- Style your components using CSS, SASS or LESS
- Dont forget to create a index.html file
- Publish your work using GitHub Pages, Heroku or Netlify.
